# 🛡️ FraudScope – Scalable Spring Boot Backend for Financial Fraud Detection

**FraudScope** is a scalable and modular Spring Boot backend designed as a foundational framework for financial fraud detection systems.  
It features secure user registration with email verification, 2FA login using OTP tokens, permission-based access control, and a structured role hierarchy.

The user domain supports both `EndUser` and `Admin` roles with isolated endpoints.  
> ⚠️ Fraud detection logic is **not implemented yet**, but the system is built with extensibility and modularity in mind.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ User Registration with Email Verification
- Email verification required before account activation  
- Verification tokens securely generated, stored, and validated

### 🔐 2FA Login with OTP Verification
- After login, users must enter a one-time password (OTP) sent to their email  
- Stateless verification using signed OTP tokens (JWT)

### 🧾 Permission-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Dynamic permissions enforced via `@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority(...)")`  
- Permissions defined in `PredefinedPermission` enum  
- Mapped to roles via `RolePermission`  
- Users linked to roles via `RoleUser`  

### 🧑‍💼 EndUser & Admin Separation
- Abstract `User` entity extended by `EndUser` and `Admin`  
- Separated services, controllers, and permission scopes  

### 🛠️ Seeder System for Initial Role & Permission Setup
- Roles & permissions seeded from enums on startup  
- `systemAuthUser` created automatically and granted all permissions  
- Executed with `@Ordered` `CommandLineRunner`  

### 🌀 AOP-Based Exception Logging
- Service-layer exceptions auto-logged with:
  - Class, method 
  - HTTP method, path, IP, User-Agent  
  - Exception type, message, timestamp  
- All captured via a custom `ExceptionLogContext` model  

### ⏱️ Scheduled Cleanup for OTP & Refresh Tokens
- Scheduled tasks:
  - Mark expired OTPs as `EXPIRED`  
  - Permanently delete old tokens  
  - Revoke expired refresh tokens  
  - Hard-delete revoked tokens after X days  

### ⚙️ Centralized Error Handling
- Global exception handler with custom `BaseException` model  
- Structured responses: `ApiError<T>`  
- Metadata included: `timestamp`, `path`, `status`, `i18nKey` support

## 🧪 Unit Testing – Authentication Flow

> **Coverage:** `34.7%` (and growing)

Unit tests written for three main services:

### ✅ `AuthServiceImpl`
- Register success & failure  
- Login success, invalid password, 2FA checks  
- Disabled or unverified user rejection  

### ✅ `VerificationTokenServiceImpl`
- Email verification flows  
- Expired, invalid, already-used token handling  

### ✅ `OtpTokenServiceImpl`
- Valid OTP entry  
- Expired, blocked, or over-limit scenarios  

Test data generated via `AuthTestDataFactory`, using `Mockito` for mocks.
